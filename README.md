# TryHackMe Tech Test

I left the mongodb api variable exposed just to make it easier to get the project up and running, ordinarily I wouldn't do this

to run the server:
 - cd server && npm i
 - npm run server

to run the client:
 - npm i
 - npm run dev

## Other things I wanted to do:
 - I never got around to shifting all the functions into their own folder of helpers, I find this format is easier to read for small projects?
 - Add user/s & auth
 - Add a lot more UI aesthetics, would look nice? but quite time consuming
 - Table columns with more data maybe?
 - Clean up Submit/amend mode
